# Game-Bois

## For gamers

There are sadly no releases available at this moment.  
But once there are you can find them in the [releases](https://github.com/Slamakans/Game-Bois/releases) tab.

## For contributors
##### Setup
To setup, just clone the repository and in Unity select `Open Project` on the newly created folder. Not much more to it than that.

##### Committing code
Committing code is done as normal, but after some changes *(don't matter big or small)* make sure to update the `AppInfo.COMMON.VERSION` value in a correct manner.

The file containing the `VERSION` value can be found at the following path:  
[`/Assets/Scripts/AppInfo/Common.cs`](https://github.com/Slamakans/Game-Bois/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/AppInfo/Common.cs#L9)

The versioning uses *"Semantic versioning"*.  
Please follow this guide: [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)
